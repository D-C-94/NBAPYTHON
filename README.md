# NBAPYTHON
Exploratory Data Analysis of NBA player stats using pandas.

Data for this project was sourced from the website www.basketball-reference.com and scraped using python. This does some basic exploratory anaylsis on player age and how it affects core facets of their game such as ability to score points. Matplotlib and seaborn were the primary visualization tools to create the various histograms, line graphs, box and whisker plots and heat maps shown in this project. 

This project aims to explore the relationship between player position, age, and performance. More specifically, how some perennial players such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are statistical outliers.
